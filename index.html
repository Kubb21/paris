      <h1>Hi, I am Sam Walters</h1>
        <p>I hail from Wisconsin located on the west side of Lake Michigan. I highly recommend making a trip to Wisconsin at some point in time, <a href="#midwest">read</a> more about Wisconsin in the link below. You probably will be shocked in what you might find in Wisconsin.
          Some of my favorite hobbies are juggling, playing mandolin, skiing, exercising, cooking, knitting, suduko, reading, drinking coffee, learning
          as much as I want to;) I try to be very 'conscience' of what I do and say. I do my best to tell the truth, and live my life with all of its struggles, but man, I am surely blessed when I acheive happiness.<br><br>

          I love to travel because of all the unnecessary (maybe necessary) struggles that occur while traveling. Some of the lessons I have been taught
          are due to my travels. Traveling the world, is when my eyes widen the most through the experiences of immersing myself in other countries and cultures. Along the way, I have been grateful to have met so many wonderful people.
          I learn something amazing from each person, for example when you eat a grapefruit enjoy the bitterness becasue life isn't always going to be so sweet. And my goal is to pass on something special to them.<br><br>

          Like many stories go it starts with a dream. I always had a strong inclination to travel, and my first thoughts about travel is when I heard that people travel to Europe with only a backpack.
          This was always an image that I wanted to be painted into. I finally took the steps to make traveling a passion of mine in 2015. I moved to Athens, Georgia to live with my oldest brother, Tygh. I was 18 years old,
          and I needed a change in my life. It was a great experience, and moving to GA fueled me to continue with my travel plans. During my time in Georgia, I would call my best friend, Hope, she was back home in Wisconsin, and
          we would discuss plans to go on our first trip. We chose Hawaii, a dream of ours since we became friends. This was a huge point in my life. If I have a dream and enough passion IT WILL HAPPEN. My passion for travel has only grown with each experience.
          I have been continously traveling with breaks in between since 2015. Find out more about each of my desitinations, and how I have made travel work for me. I hope you enjoy my stories and will get something out of each one. I always travel with a
          purpose, and in hopes of growing to be a better human being. Welcome!(firm handshake)</p>

    <!-- We started to break down our plans, we knew it was goint to expensive there so we wanted to figure out an affordable plan. WWOOFing came tom mind,
    (World Wide Opportunites on Organic Farms) This made a lot of sense to us. We packed our bags and set off on our first travel desitnation together. As our wonderful wwoofing experience went on the travel itch
    became stronger. During our two month stay, we booked our next trip to Europe. We had no clue what we were in for, but we knew we would be alright. Shortly after we came home from Hawaii Hope and I were off to Europe.-->
