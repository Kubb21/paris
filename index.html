      <h1>Hi, I am Sam Walters</h1>
        <p>I hail from Wisconsin located on the west side of Lake Michigan.
          I highly recommend making a trip to Wisconsin at some point in time,
          <a href="./midwest.html">read</a> more about Wisconsin.
          You will be shocked what you might find in Wisconsin.
          Some of my favorite hobbies are juggling, playing mandolin,
          skiing, exercising, cooking, knitting, suduko, reading, drinking coffee, learning
          as much as I want to;) I try to be very 'conscience' of what I do and say.
          I do my best to tell the truth, and live my life with all of its struggles, but man,
          I am surely blessed when I acheive happiness.<br><br>

          I am grateful to have met so many wonderful people.
          I gain a metaphorical souviner from each person, for example when you eat a grapefruit enjoy the bitterness because
          life isn't always going to be so sweet. And my goal is to pass on something special to them.
          I love to travel because of all the unnecessary...(maybe necessary) struggles that occur while traveling.
          All of these lessons are due to my travels.
          Traveling the world is when my eyes widen the most from the encounters
          of immersing myself in each destination and their cultures.<br><br>

          As many stories go it starts with a dream. I always had a strong inclination to travel,
          and my first thoughts of travel is when I discovered people backpack through Europe.
          This was an image that I wanted to be painted into. I was 18 years old in 2015, and finally, I took steps to
          make traveling a passion of mine. I moved to Athens, Georgia to live with my oldest brother, Tygh.
          It was a great experience that fueled me to continue with my travel dreams. During my time in Georgia, I would call my
          best friend, Hope, she was back home in Wisconsin, and we would discuss plans to go on our first trip.
          We chose <a href="./westcoast.html">Hawaii</a>, a dream of ours since we became friends 8 years ago.
          This was a huge realization in my life understanding if I have enough passion IT WILL HAPPEN.
          My passion for travel has only grown with each experience.
          I have been continously traveling with breaks in between since 2015. Find out more about each of my desitinations,
          and how I have made travel work for me. I hope you enjoy my stories and will get a metaphorical souviner out of each one.
          I always travel with a purpose in hopes of growing to be a better human being. Welcome!(firm handshake)</p>

    <!-- We started to break down our plans, we knew it was goint to expensive there so we wanted to figure out an affordable plan. WWOOFing came tom mind,
    (World Wide Opportunites on Organic Farms) This made a lot of sense to us. We packed our bags and set off on our first travel desitnation together. As our wonderful wwoofing experience went on the travel itch
    became stronger. During our two month stay, we booked our next trip to Europe. We had no clue what we were in for, but we knew we would be alright. Shortly after we came home from Hawaii Hope and I were off to Europe.-->
